# awfl CLI: dev command module

Purpose
- Provide a first-class developer experience for running the AWFL stack locally, mirroring the original dev.sh script while adding interactive configuration and safety.
- Orchestrate local services used during workflow development:
  - Environment bootstrapping (.env)
  - Ngrok tunnel and BASE_URL export
  - Docker Compose up/down
  - Scala sbt-based workflow YAML generation and auto-deploy on change

Key behaviors at a glance
- dev start ensures .env exists (creates from .env.example and exits so you can fill secrets on first run).
- Starts/attaches to an ngrok tunnel, waits for the https URL, and exports BASE_URL in-process.
- Optionally brings Docker Compose up (with build) and tails logs via dev logs.
- Starts a watcher that regenerates YAMLs (sbt) and optionally auto-deploys changes.
- dev stop reliably tears everything down (watcher, compose, ngrok).
- dev status summarizes effective settings, paths, and runtime state.

Design and approach
- Single responsibility modules. The previous monolithic core.py was broken up into focused helpers:
  - paths.py: repository/workflows discovery and path helpers
  - dev_config.py: persisted config under ~/.awfl/dev_config.json
  - dev_state.py: in-process ephemeral state for the current CLI session
  - ngrok_utils.py: start/stop ngrok and tunnel discovery
  - docker_utils.py: compose up/down/status/logs
  - yaml_ops.py: sbt-driven YAML generation, change detection, deploy logic
  - watcher.py: async task that watches sources, triggers generation, and optionally deploys
  - prompt_utils.py: minimal input helpers and .env checks
- Thin compatibility shim. core.py re-exports the public API from the split modules. Existing callers can import from .core without breakage. Newer code should prefer direct imports from the concrete modules.
- Consistent logging. All user-facing output flows through utils.log_unique to de-duplicate noisy lines while retaining important updates.
- Safety and teardown. Shutdown hooks (SIGINT/SIGTERM + atexit) ensure dev stop behavior is applied on Ctrl-C or process exit.

Commands
- dev start [--no-ngrok] [--no-compose] [--no-watch] [--port N] [--auto-deploy=on|off] [--compose-file PATH] [--workflows-dir PATH] [--location REGION] [--project ID] [--reconfigure|-r] [-y|--yes] [--no-prompt]
  - Ensures .env, starts ngrok and exports BASE_URL, optionally composes up and starts the Scala watcher.
  - Interactive prompts are shown on first run or with --reconfigure. Selections can be saved to ~/.awfl/dev_config.json.
- dev stop [--no-ngrok] [--no-compose]
  - Stops the watcher, composes down, and stops ngrok (mirrors dev.sh teardown).
- dev status
  - Prints repo/workflows paths, ngrok URL, compose status, watcher status, last changed YAMLs, and default deploy target with env suffix.
- dev generate-yamls
  - Runs sbt clean compile and shows changed YAMLs.
- dev deploy-workflow workflows/yaml_gens/<file>.yaml
  - Substitutes ${WORKFLOW_ENV} via a temporary file, derives workflow name, and deploys with detailed history.
- dev logs [--follow]
  - Shows Docker Compose logs from the discovered compose file.

Configuration
- Persisted config path: ~/.awfl/dev_config.json
  - Keys: confirmed, ngrok_port, auto_deploy, use_ngrok, use_compose, use_watch, compose_file, workflows_dir, location, project
- Environment variables (selected):
  - AWFL_NGROK_PORT: default port for ngrok (default 8081)
  - AUTO_DEPLOY: on/off (default on)
  - AWFL_GCLOUD_LOCATION: default region (default us-central1)
  - PROJECT: default GCP project (default topaigents if unspecified in status)
  - WORKFLOW_ENV: suffix used in deploy names (e.g., Dev)

File structure
- commands.py: dispatches the dev subcommands (start/stop/logs/generate/deploy/status)
- core.py: thin compatibility layer re-exporting public APIs
- subcommands/
  - start.py: startup flow, interactive config, ngrok/compose/watcher bootstrap
  - stop.py: teardown flow for watcher/compose/ngrok, cleans state
  - logs.py: docker compose logs wrapper
  - generate.py: sbt trigger and YAML change reporting
  - deploy.py: WORKFLOW_ENV substitution, name derivation, deploy invocation
  - status.py: runtime summary (paths, ngrok, compose, watcher, last changes)
- helpers/
  - paths.py, dev_config.py, dev_state.py, ngrok_utils.py, docker_utils.py, yaml_ops.py, watcher.py, prompt_utils.py

Conventions and guardrails
- Use sys.executable for Python subprocesses outside this module to avoid mixed venvs.
- Prefer direct imports from concrete modules; keep core.py stable for external callers.
- Keep logs succinct and stable; use log_unique to avoid log storms.
- Be careful with RUN_COMMAND elsewhere in the CLI; dev commands are user-facing and should not invoke arbitrary shell without clear intent.

Troubleshooting tips
- Ngrok URL not detected: ensure ngrok is installed and in PATH; check AWFL_NGROK_PORT; run ngrok http <port> manually to test.
- Compose missing: set or confirm the compose file path via dev start --reconfigure; run docker compose ls to verify plugin presence.
- sbt build issues: ensure sbt and Java are installed; try dev generate-yamls to see errors and changed files.
- ADC/gcloud errors on deploy: ensure gcloud is installed and authenticated; verify PROJECT and AWFL_GCLOUD_LOCATION.

Roadmap
- Gradually migrate imports away from the core shim and add docstrings/types across helper modules.
- Optional: surface BASE_URL explicitly in dev status; add unit tests for derive_workflow_name and substitution logic.
